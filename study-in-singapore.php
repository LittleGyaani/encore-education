								<p>Singapore has more than 66,000 foreign students of 60 different nationalities. Foreign nationals have the choice of either studying in international schools which follow various international education systems or in government schools under the Singapore education system.
								</p>
							</br>
							<p>The country's bilingual policy has attracted many foreign students keen to polish their English and Mandarin proficiency.

							</br>	There are only 8 Universities and 5 Polytechnics in Singapore and rest all are Private colleges.
							</p>
							<p>Polytechnics in Singapore provide three-year diploma courses and accept students based on their GCE O-level, GCE A-level or Institute of Technical Education (ITE) results.
							</p>
						</br>
						<p>Polytechnics offer a wide range of courses in various fields, including engineering, business studies, accountancy, tourism and hospitality management, mass communications, digital media,humanities, social sciences and biotechnology. There are also specialised courses such as marine engineering, nautical studies, nursing, aviation management, social enterprise and optometry. They provide a more industry-oriented education as an alternative to junior colleges for post-secondary studies. About 40% of each Primary 1 cohort will enrol in polytechnics.
						</p>
					</br>
					<p>Polytechnic graduates with good grades can continue to pursue further tertiary education at local and many overseas universities, notably those in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, and be exempted for modules completed in their polytechnics.
					</p>
				</br>
				<p>Polytechnics have also been actively working with many foreign universities to provide their graduates a chance to study niche university courses locally. For example, Ngee Ann Polytechnic has engaged Chapman University in the United States to provide a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Producing for graduates of the School's Film and Media Studies department. Likewise, Nanyang Polytechnic has tied up with the University of Stirling in Scotland to provide a course in retail marketing. This is known as the Poly-FSI tie-up.
